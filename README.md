## Local Development

Make sure you activate the venv before installing packages!

1. To activate the venv, you can run `source venv/bin/activate` from the root directory.
2. After doing so, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required packages.
    * If you want to add new packages, add them to the requirements.txt and then re-run the above command (don't perform `pip install` for individual packages!)
